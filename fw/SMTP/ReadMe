1. When authentication is used, user needs to send the command like  
   "./msmtp -d --host=192.168.58.99 --user=Doris --auth=login -f=192.168.0.102 doris@192.168.58.99 < mail.txt"
   After this command is excuted, user will be asked to type the password later.
   However, this is not suitable for our firmware use.
   We modified msmtp.c to resolve this, and the msmtp AP can read the password from the command line now.
   The command may like " ./msmtp -d --host=192.168.58.99 --user=Doris:dorispwd --auth=login -f=192.168.0.102 doris@192.168.58.99 < conf.c",
   where "dorispwd" is the password of the user Doris.
